Decide what matters most to you as a parent and start each morning with a moment that reminds you and your child (or children) of what that is. This could be taking deep breaths together, sharing what you feel grateful for , or a mini-dance party.",

          "Check-in with your child’s teacher. If aspects of distance learning are not working for you or your child, speak up.  Teachers are flying the airplane while building it. They need your feedback to be successful. Don’t be shy about telling them what you need.",
          "Stand up and move. Kids' brains and bodies are not made for sitting in front of a computer all day. If possible, try getting outside for a quick walk or play break or find ways to get your bodies moving indoors through stretches, dancing, or exercise. Schedule time to be kind to yourself throughout the day. Distance learning is hard, if not impossible! Show your kids that it is helpful to  recharge your batteries when feeling low."
