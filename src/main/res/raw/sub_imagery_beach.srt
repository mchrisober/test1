1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
First, remove distractions - let others know not to bother you.
 
2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Make yourself comfortable, so that your thoughts are on the image and nothing else.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sit, or lie down, in a quiet, comfortable place.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then, mentally scan your body for tense muscles.

5
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:27,000
If you find a muscle that tense, or clenched, relax it.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
During the imagery exercise, involve all of your senses in the image: sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Get completely focused.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The more focused you are, the better.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Close your eyes, or lower your gaze.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In your mind's eye, you see yourself descending down a long, narrow, wooden stairway, toward a beautiful, inviting beach.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Your bare feet feel the rough, weathered step.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And with each step, you feel more and more tension gently melting away from your body.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
As you continue down the stairway, you notice the ocean is a deep shade of blue, with the fine, white crests of the waves sweeping towards the shore.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You reach the end of the stairway, and step down, sinking into the warmth.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
As you soak in the warmth of the sun, a soothing sensation of relaxation gently melts through your entire body.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The gentle sounds of the water lapping up onto the beach calm your mind, and allow you to feel even more relaxed.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You begin walking slowly towards the edge of the water, and feel the warm sun on your face and shoulders.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The salty smell of the ocean air invigorates you, and you take in a deep breath.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Breathe slowly out, and feel more relaxed and refreshed.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Finally, you reach the water's edge, and you gladly invite the little surges to flow over your toes and ankles.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You watch the surges glide slowly towards you, gently sweeping around your feet, and the trails of ocean water that flows slowly back out again.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The cool water feels soft and comforting, as you enjoy a few moments, allowing yourself to gaze out on the far-reaching horizon.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Overhead, you notice two birds gracefully soaring high above the ocean.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And you can hear their soft cries becoming faint as they glide away.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All of these sights, sounds, and sensations allow you to relax and let go, more and more.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
After a few moments, you begin slowly strolling down the beach, at the water's edge.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
As you walk down the beach, you notice the details of sights and sounds around you, and the soothing sensations of the sun, the gentle breeze, and the sand below your feet.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:08,000
As you continue your leisurely walk down the beach, you notice a colorful beach chair, resting in a nice, peaceful spot, where the powdery, soft sand lies undisturbed.

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You approach this comfortable-looking beach chair, then you sit down, lie back, and settle in.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You take in a long, deep breath, breathe slowly out, and feel even more relaxed and comfortable, resting in your chair.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For a few moments more, let yourself enjoy the sights and sounds of this beautiful day on the beach.

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
When you're ready, gently bring your attention back to the room, still letting yourself feel relaxed and comfortable, sitting where you are.
