1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Start this exercise by finding a comfortable position sitting in a chair, or lying on a bed or the floor.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Relax.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Don't let yourself drift off to sleep during this exercise, but allow yourself to rest.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now slowly bring your awareness to the tips of your fingers.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Feel your fingers.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now, rub your fingertips together.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How do they feel?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Can you feel the small indentations on that are your fingerprints?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Take your time and try to feel them.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What do they feel like?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Are your fingertips raw from lots of work or are they smooth?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How does it feel to rub them together?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Notice the sensations.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now rest your fingers where they were before.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are they touching?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are they resting on a blanket, on the arms of your chair, on your legs or stomach, or something else?

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What does that feel like?

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is it soft or hard?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Does it have any other distinguishing features or textures?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Take the time to completely absorb the way these objects feel to your fingertips.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now bring attention to your hands and arms. What do they feel like?

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Perhaps they are relaxed and heavy.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Perhaps they are tense from work or stress.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Either way is okay.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There is no need to judge; simply observe the feelings in your arms and hands.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are there any aches or pains?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Take note of these, but don't fixate on them. Simply notice the pain and move on.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Move your attention down to your toes now.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Wiggle them around a little. Are they in shoes or socks?

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are they free to move about?

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wiggle them and notice whatever is around or under them.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you notice air, or the feeling of blankets or socks?

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Be aware of the experience.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Just notice the sensations as you bring your awareness to your feet.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Now shift your attention, and notice how your head is positioned.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is it upright or tilted?

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is your head turned in a particular direction?

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Simply notice your head's positioning without trying to change it.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Also notice any sensations that you are experiencing in your head or neck, such as tension or relaxation.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Take your time noticing.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What about your face? How does your face feel?

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There are all kinds of sensations to explore here.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Think about your brow. Is it smooth and flat or is it wrinkled up with stress?

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Again, don't try to change it, just notice it.

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now bring awareness to your nose. Can you breathe freely?

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Think about your brow. Is it smooth and flat or is it wrinkled up with stress?

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Again, don't try to change it, just notice it.

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now bring awareness to your nose. Can you breathe freely?

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Take a few breaths in and out through your nose.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Can you feel air flowing into your nose?

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is the air warm or cool?

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Pay attention to these feelings for a moment.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then think about your mouth.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How is it positioned?

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is it pursed? Open? Closed?

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What about the inside of your mouth? Is it wet or dry?

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Explore all of the sensations throughout your face.

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Perhaps your skin feels dry, or you notice other sensations of itching, tingling, heaviness, heat, or coolness.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Perhaps there are no feeling at all. Just notice.

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now bring your attention to your chest and belly.

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Place one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Can you feel your body breathing? What is that like?

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you breathing fast or slow?

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is your breath going more into your belly or your chest?

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How does that feel?

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now invert that pattern, breathing in through your mouth and out through your nose, and notice how that feels.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now breathe naturally, just noticing the sensations.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Next place your hands wherever they were before and expand your attention to include your whole body.

71
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Where are you sitting or lying?

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Can you feel the back side of your body touching the chair or bed in various places?

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Be mindful of the way your body is positioned.

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There is no need to move, just observe.

75
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Now, with your eyes still closed, imagine the room you're in.

76
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where are you positioned in the room?

77
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you have a sense of where the door is?

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Can you feel your body in the larger space?

79
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
When you are ready, open your eyes and look around the room.

80
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can move if you wish.

81
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Notice where the various pieces of furniture and decoration are.

82
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What do they look like?

83
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You can spend as much time as you like investigating different aspects of the room.

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Remember not to judge, just to notice.

85
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Whenever you are ready, you can stop this exercise and continue with your day.
