1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,560
try to create a sense of being a compassionate person

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,960
focus on your desires to become a compassionate person

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,140
and to be able to think

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,420
feel

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and act compassionately

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,680
imagine yourself with each of the qualities of compassion

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,740
wisdom

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,340
strength

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,280
warmth

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,320
and responsibility

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,500
some days this will be easier than others

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,200
but hold on

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,720
to even the slightest glimmer of feeling like a compassionate person

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,900
next

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,360
think about someone you care about

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,500
it could be a partner or a friend

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,840
a parent or a child

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,040
or even a beloved animal

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,080
focus on them

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
and direct your attention towards them

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,020
with three basic feelings and thoughts

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,960
may you be well

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,000
may you be happy

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,360
may you be free from suffering

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,500
remember that it is your behavior and intentions

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,120
that are important

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,040
rather than how he or she will react

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
be gentle

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,180
take your time

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
and allow yourself to focus on the desires

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,800
and wishes

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,060
you create for this other person

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,760
it may help to picture them smiling

34
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,300
and sharing these feelings

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,400
spend some time

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,920
simply focusing on this genuine desire

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,340
for the other person to be happy
