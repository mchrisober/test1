1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Start this exercise by sitting comfortably in a chair with your feet squarely on the floor.
 
2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sit with your posture firm, but not rigid.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:22,000
Make sure your head feels centered over your shoulders and place your arms in a comfortable position at your sides or on your lap.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,000
This posture helps you stay alert and focused.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,000
Begin by noticing that your body is sensing the environment around you.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,000
Notice that you can feel yourself sitting in your chair.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Feel your feet on the ground

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,000
and feel your clothes on your skin.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You might feel the bend of your knees or elbows.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, gently close your eyes, or locate a place in front of you where you can let your eyes rest, like the floor or a wall.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:11,000
Notice that as you close, or soften, your eyes, your ears tend to open and sound is more available to you.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Take a few moments to pay attention to all of the sounds that you hear.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now gently release your attention from the sounds around you.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Place your attention on the tip of your nose, and then begin to pay attention to the sensation of air moving in and out of your nostrils.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Notice the change in temperature between the in breath and the out breath.

16
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Allow yourself to gently follow your breathing, paying attention to the air passing in and out of your body.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You may also notice the rise and fall of your chest and belly as you breathe.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Feel that expansion and contraction.

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:34,000
Relax into your breathing, and allow it to be natural and unforced.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you become distracted by your thoughts, just take a moment to notice where the thoughts took you.

21
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:57,000
Then, without judgment, let go and return your attention to your breathing.

22
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:11,000
If you get distracted 100 times, that's ok - just bring yourself back to your breath 100 times.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, take the next few minutes to attend completely to your breathing.

24
00:03:16,400 --> 00:07:29,000
You won't hear my voice for the next 5 minutes.

25
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Now gently release your attention from your breathing and bring your focus back to hearing.

26
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Take a moment to be aware of the sounds around you.

27
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now, releasing your attention from sound, gently focus on the sensations in your body.

28
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Notice the placement of your feet, arms, and head.

29
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When you are ready, open and refocus your eyes. Gently begin to move and go on with your day.
