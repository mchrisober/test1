1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,420
Memory can be a great tool

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,520
for provoking and practicing compassion

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,720
Begin with your compassionate posture

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,160
Find a comfortable position

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,100
You can close your eyes

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,800
or just look down

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,960
or have an unfocused gaze

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,480
Lift your shoulders up and back

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,900
and notice how this creates a concave curve in your back that lifts your diaphragm

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,560
When we â€˜re stressed

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,220
the body tends to curl inwards

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,720
So here we open up the chest and body

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,420
Let the body support itself

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,080
rather than leaning or slouching Shoulders

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,620
Shoulders are in line with the hips

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,180
and feet are flat
on the floor or resting comfortably

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,120
a shoulders width a part

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,620
Everything is in line

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,280
We are sitting

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,300
or standing with dignity

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,860
confidence

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,620
and attention

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,940
Form a friendly expression on your face

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,420
as if you are showing friendship for someone you care about

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,560
Although this may feel unnatural to do

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,980
expressions can affect systems in your brain

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,540
and change the way you think or the way you feel

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,940
So now with our compassion posture

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,820
we are going to move gently

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,180
into soothing and grounding breathing rhythms

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,340
We breathe in gently through the nose

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,620
for around five seconds

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,140
noticing the stillness at the top of the breath

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,860
and then breathing out

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,700
for around five seconds

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,840
noticing the stillness at the bottom of the breath

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,060
We are breathing in

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,360
and out

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,880
through the nose

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,080
gently

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,120
not flaring the nostrils

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
easy in

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,780
and easy out

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,620
a nice smooth

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,980
and even

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
rhythm of breathing

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,660
Once you feel that your body has slowed down a bit

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,480
you might allow your body posture and facial expression

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,300
to become compassionate

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,920
Feel free to play around with postures and facial expressions

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,880
but whatever expression and posture you go with

52
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,180
they should be gentle

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,920
Once you are ready

54
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,440
think of a time when someone was kind to you

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,420
Not a time when you were in distress

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,760
just a time when someone was kind to you

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,380
A time when someone treated you with compassion

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
grace

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,580
dignity

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,940
or kindness

61
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,280
Put on your compassionate expression

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,320
and adopt the compassionate body posture

63
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,120
you have cultivated

64
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,960
as you remember the compassion you received

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Recall how it felt to receive that kindness

66
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,520
Spend a minute thinking

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,540
about the expressions of the person who was kind to you

68
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,840
and mimicking them

69
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,480
if that helps

70
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,020
If youâ€™re having trouble remembering them

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,400
imagine the person moving towards you

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
with a smile on their face

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,820
or their head tilted to one side

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,360
While recalling the memory

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,420
focus on the important sensory qualities

76
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,860
of your memory

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,620
Try the following steps

78
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
One

79
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,240
Focus on the kinds of things this person
said

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
as well as the tone of their voice when the spoke

81
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,580
Spend a minute thinking

82
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,200
about the kind things that this person said

83
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,780
Next

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,360
focus on the feeling of the emotion in the person

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
what they really felt for you at the moment

86
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,340
Focus on that for another minute

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,720
Finally

88
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,220
focus on the entire experience

89
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,260
Think about whether they touched you in a friendly or comforting way

90
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,160
or whether they helped you in some other way

91
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Allow the experience of gratitude

92
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,260
and joy in being helped grow
inside of you

93
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,920
Remember to keep your expression as compassionate as you can

94
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Spend a few minutes in this step

95
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,060
When you are ready

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,180
let the memory gently fade away

97
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,680
Come slowly out of the exercise

98
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,780
and allow this feeling of compassion

99
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,420
and kindness

100
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,100
to carry into the rest of your day

101
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
and your interactions with others

102
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,260
in your life
