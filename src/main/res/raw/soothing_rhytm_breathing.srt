1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,660
Find a comfortable position

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,600
You can close your eyes

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,060
or just look down

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,820
or have an unfocused gaze

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,540
Lift your shoulders up and back

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
and notice how this creates a concave curve in your back

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,380
that lifts your diaphragm

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,760
When we are stressed

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,300
the body tends to curl inwards

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,320
So here

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,980
we open up the chest and body

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,420
Let the body support itself

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,480
rather than leaning or slouching

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,560
Shoulders are in line with the hips

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,140
and feet are flat on the floor

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,300
or resting comfortably

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,680
a shoulders width apart

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,200
Everything is in line

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,060
we are sitting with dignity

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,600
confidence

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,120
and attention

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,280
Form a friendly expression on your face

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,400
as if you are showing friendship for someone you like

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,900
Although this may feel unnatural to do it like this

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,900
your expressions can affect systems in your brain

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,080
and change how you think or feel

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,580
So now with our compassion posture

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,580
we are going to move gently

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,060
into soothing and grounding breathing rhythms

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,000
We breathe in gently through the nose

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,880
for around five seconds

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,280
noticing the stillness at the top of the breath

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,040
and then breathing out for around five seconds

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,360
noting the stillness at the bottom of the breath

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
We are Breathing in

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,320
and out

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,980
through the nose

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,240
gently

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,600
without flaring of the nostrils

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,160
Easy in

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,160
and easy out

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,330
a nice

43
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,140
smooth

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,140
even rhythm of breathing

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,980
Remember that it is okay for your mind to
wander

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,740
just notice where it wanders

47
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,100
and gently guide it back to awareness of your body

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
Feel the air flowing in and out of your nostrils

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,320
and simply allow yourself to be

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,420
If you find yourself stuck on noticing your breathing

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,440
let yourself focus on an object instead

52
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,820
You can hold something like a smooth stone

53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,000
or a soft ball

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,000
something that feels good to hold

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Focus on the object as well as your breathing

56
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,620
and note the way it feels to hold the object

57
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,680
Take the next minute

58
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,920
to allow yourself to find your nice

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,200
slow

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,680
even rhythm of breathing

61
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,740
When youâ€™re ready

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,020
slowly open your eyes

63
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
and bring yourself back to the present moment

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
A small stretch

65
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
and a deep breath

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,640
can help you ready yourself for the rest of your day
