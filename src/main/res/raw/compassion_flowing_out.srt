1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,880
Think about a time when you felt very kind

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,060
and caring towards a person

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,140
or a beloved animal

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,380
Try not to choose a time

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,300
when that person or animal was very distressed

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,080
because then you are likely to focus on that distress

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,020
instead of the kind compassionate feelings for him or her

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,540
Next

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,280
focus on the desire to help the person or animal

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,220
and the feelings of kindness that will guide you to help

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,060
Remember that in this exercise

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,200
it is your intentions that are important

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,380
not how the person or animal responds

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,100
Bring to mind a specific time

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,160
when you felt compassionate towards him or her

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,400
imagine yourself expanding

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,740
as if you are becoming calmer

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,360
wise

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,980
stronger

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,160
more responsible

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,140
and able to help him or her

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,920
Pay attention to your body

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,840
as you remember how it felt to be kind

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,040
Spend some time expanding

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,320
with warmth in your body

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,880
Notice the genuine desire

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,380
for this person to be free of suffering

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,220
and to flourish

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,020
Spend a minute or two

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,060
thinking about the tone of your voice

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,360
and the kinds of things you said

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,720
or the kinds of things you did

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
or wanted to do to help

34
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,160
Spend another minute or two

35
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,220
thinking about how good it felt to be kind to him or her

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Finally

37
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,940
focus only on your desire to be helpful
and kind

38
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,260
the sense of warmth

39
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,000
feelings of expansion

40
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,740
your kind tone of voice

41
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,600
the wisdom in your voice

42
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,460
and the wisdom in your behavior

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,540
When have finished this exercise

44
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,260
you might allow yourself to take these feelings of compassion

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,900
and kindness

46
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,820
into the rest of your day

47
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,460
and how you interact with others around you
