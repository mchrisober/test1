1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:09,620
You are invited to sit in a comfortable position with both feet on the floor, being alert but not rigid.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Begin by first noticing or paying attention to your body,

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,180
noticing that it is actively sensing the environment.

4
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,420
Notice that you can feel yourself sitting in the chair

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
and that you can feel your feet on the ground.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,440
Also notice that you can feel the clothes on your skin and perhaps your jewelry.

7
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,240
Notice, too, that you might feel the bend of your knees or elbows.

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:22,680
Now, gently close your eyes or locate a place in front of you where you can gently rest your gaze, eyes half open.

9
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,720
Notice as you close your eyes that your ears tend to open.

10
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,640
Take a few moments and pay attention to all the sounds that you hear.

11
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,380
Notice each sound as it comes into your awareness.

12
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,140
Notice its quality and intensity.

13
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,280
Gently be aware of each sound as it comes and goes.

14
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,140
Now simply take a few moments to be aware of sound.

15
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:21,240
Now gently releasing your attention from sound, place your attention on sensations of the skin,

16
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,640
paying attention to any sensation at the skin that arises into your awareness.

17
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,560
This may be a sense of coolness or warmth,

18
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,860
this may be an experience of air on the skin.

19
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,000
It may be an itch or a tingling.

20
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:00,420
Simply be aware of all sensations that arise as you pay attention to sensation at the skin.

21
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,000
If you get distracted, gently return to being aware of sensing at the skin.

22
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,480
Now gently releasing your attention from sensations at the skin,

23
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:27,500
place your attention at the tip of your nose and begin to notice the sensation of air moving in and out of your nostrils,

24
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,880
paying attention to your breathing.

25
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:44,300
You may notice that the air coming in through your nostrils is slightly cooler than the air moving out of your nostrils.

26
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,160
Allow yourself to just gently follow your breathing,

27
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,100
paying attention to the gentle easy air as it passes in and out of your body.

28
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,420
As you attend to your breathing, you may also notice the rise and fall of your chest.

29
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:55,240
Simply be aware of the sensations of expansion and contraction, rising and falling.

30
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
Be your breathing.

31
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,820
If you become distracted by your thoughts, simply take a moment to notice where your thoughts took you.

32
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:26,560
Give a gentle “nod” to distraction and then without judgment, return your attention to your breathing.

33
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:39,440
If you get distracted a hundred times, bring yourself back one hundred times, returning to your breath.

34
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,600
Take the next few minutes to focus completely on breathing, attending to the rise and fall.

35
00:09:50,320 --> 00:10:00,000
Now, gently releasing your attention from your breathing and bringing your attention back, return to hearing.

36
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,640
Take a moment or two to be aware of the sounds that you notice in the room.

37
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:28,780
Now releasing your attention from sound, gently focus on your body and how it feels to sit in the chair.

38
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,340
Notice the placement of your feet, arms and head,

39
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,840
picture what the room will look like and when you're ready,

40
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,160
rejoin the room by opening your eyes.

41
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,220
Thank you for doing this mindfulness exercise.
