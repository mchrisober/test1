1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,400
this exercise

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,280
can be focused on two different parts of yourself

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,460
a part of you that sometimes feels troubled

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,440
and a part of you that sometimes feels anxious

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,460
it will help if you've already tried

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,620
some of the other compassion exercises in this app

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,480
so that you can imagine
yourself

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,920
as a completely compassionate person

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,080
full of wisdom

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,040
strength

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,360
warmth

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,980
and responsibility

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,180
start by coming to a quiet and
contemplative place

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,140
notice how your body feels

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,500
and focus on your facial expressions

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,200
form a friendly expression on your face

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,700
as if you are showing friendship for someone you care about

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,020
for the first part of this exercise

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,260
we'll focus on the part of you

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,400
that sometimes feels troubled

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,900
imagine that you are watching a video of yourself

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,020
like you're watching a movie

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
you watch yourself get up in the morning

24
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,920
moving around your bedroom

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,860
and preparing yourself for the day

26
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,040
notice when or how the person you are
watching

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,771
might be troubled by self critical
thoughts

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,620
be in touch with their struggle

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,980
but don't get dragged down into it

30
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,260
keep your compassionate self forward

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,820
looking through the eyes of compassion

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,380
and with the intention of being warm

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,120
kind

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,080
and helpful

35
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,940
as you watch

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,760
try to be aware of how you

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,620
the person in this home movie

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,680
feels critical

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,460
troubled

40
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,720
or feels difficult emotions

41
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,220
as they go about their day

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,460
as the viewer

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,920
you can see the things that trouble this person

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,140
and you can allow yourself to have compassion for them

45
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,140
if you sense your compassionate self wandering away

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,620
let the imagery fade

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,740
and go back to the first exercise

48
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,680
recapture your compassionate
expression

49
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,020
in your upright posture

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,880
to begin again

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,560
this exercise

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,000
can help you adopt a more objective view of yourself

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,080
and your struggles

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,060
a very difficult thing to do

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,020
can also help you develop your own intuitive wisdom

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,340
and abilities to heal

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,860
to become more accepting of yourself

58
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,660
for the second version

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,240
the focus will be on your anxious self

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,120
whether you have a diagnosis

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,960
of anxiety or not

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,320
you likely struggle with some anxiety

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,580
this exercise can help you tap into your compassion

64
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,200
for your anxious self

65
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,600
like you did with your troubled self

66
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,960
spend a few minutes engaging your compassionate self

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
feel yourself slowing down

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,920
and adopt your compassionate expression

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
next

70
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,160
imagine yourself in a situation where you become anxious

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,100
remember to keep your compassionate position

72
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,300
look at your anxious self through the eyes of your compassion self

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,260
in practice compassion for the person that you see

74
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,420
understand and empathize with your anxious self

75
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,740
and extend compassion to him or her

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,080
imagine how you might like to help that person

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,720
what you might want to say to help them deal with their anxiety

78
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,380
you might say something to validate their emotions

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,060
or you may say something encouraging

80
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,200
to help them recognize their ability

81
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,780
to pull through the anxiety

82
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,380
whatever you say

83
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,520
make sure that it's kind

84
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,420
and helpful

85
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,720
imagine time gradually moving

86
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,420
and see yourself gradually reducing your anxiety

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,800
until enough time has passed

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,820
that the anxiety is all gone

89
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,180
get a sense of how it feels to have come through an anxiety episode

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,900
and offer your anxious self

91
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,880
some encouragement and understanding

92
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,820
later

93
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,220
when you're in a situation that is causing your anxiety to spike

94
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
spend a few moments

95
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,880
slowing down

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,980
reminding yourself of your compassionate self

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,580
and seeing yourself through the eyes

98
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,120
of compassion
