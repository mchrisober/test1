1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,900
the compassionate self is a vital sense
of self to develop

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,660
both for your compassion for others

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,040
and for your compassion for yourself

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,000
once again

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,100
begin with your compassionate posture

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,620
find a comfortable position

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,720
you can close your eyes

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,100
or just look down

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,560
or have an unfocused gaze

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,060
lift your shoulders

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,580
up and back

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,700
and notice how this creates a concave curve in your back that lifts your diaphragm

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
when we are stressed

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,580
the body tends to curl inwards

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,580
so here we open up the chest and body

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,900
let the body support itself

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,260
rather than leaning against the back of the chair

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,520
shoulders are in line with the hips

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,420
and feet are flat on the floor a shoulders width apart

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,460
everything is in line

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,240
we are sitting with dignity

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,540
confidence

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,260
and attention

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,680
form a friendly expression on your face

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,640
as if you are showing kindness for someone you care about

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,352
so now with our compassion posture and expression

27
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,880
we are going to move gently

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,740
into soothing and grounding breathing rhythms

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,640
we breathe in gently

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,960
through the nose

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,240
for around five seconds

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,700
noticing the stillness at the top of the breath

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,480
and then breathing out

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,340
for around five seconds

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,335
noting the stillness

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,020
at the bottom of the breath

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,040
we are breathing in

38
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,280
and out

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
through the nose

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,420
gently

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,100
not flaring the nostrils

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,960
easy in

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,480
and easy out

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,740
when your body has slowed down a bit

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,140
and you feel ready to begin

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,860
imagine that you are a deeply compassionate person

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,860
think of all the qualities

48
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,020
you would ideally have

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,080
as that compassionate person

50
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,860
focus on your desires

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,700
to become a compassionate person

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,900
and to be able to
think

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,660
feel

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,320
and act compassionately

55
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,680
imagine yourself with each of the qualities of compassion

56
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,220
wisdom

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,520
strength

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,880
warmth

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,560
and responsibility

60
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,000
first

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,920
imagine yourself with a wealth of wisdom

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,760
this wisdom comes from your understanding

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,460
about the nature of life

64
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,740
of our bodies

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,300
and of our minds

66
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,720
spend some time thinking

67
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,360
about how much goes on inside of us

68
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,480
which is not our fault

69
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,100
next

70
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,880
when you have a grasp on how it feels to have this wisdom

71
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,100
imagine having a compassionate strength

72
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,000
allow you body posture to change

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,720
in order to match how this compassionate strength feels

74
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,400
imagine yourself as a person

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,660
that understands your own difficulties

76
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,840
and understands the difficulties of others
in a non-judgmental way

77
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,800
imagine yourself as a person

78
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,360
that has the confidence to be sensitive

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,400
and the tolerance to withstand difficulties

80
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,780
when you have added a sense  of strength to your wisdom

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,700
move on to focusing on warmth

82
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,200
imagine that you are a warm

83
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,540
and kind person

84
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,520
both to yourself

85
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,160
and to others

86
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,900
create a facial expression

87
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,980
to match your compassionate self

88
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,880
and try to keep it on as you work through the exercise

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,720
imagine yourself speaking kindly to someone

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,360
and note the tone of your voice

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,740
imagine reaching out to someone with warmth

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,200
and feel what that might be like

93
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,580
finally

94
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,840
imagine yourself with a sense of
responsibility

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,160
imagine that you have no interest in condemning

96
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,260
or blaming others

97
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,840
or yourself

98
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,000
imagine that you only want to do the best you can do

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,860
to help yourself

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,140
and help others through difficult situations

101
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,280
hold on to your compassionate facial expression

102
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,540
focus on the experience of committing yourself

103
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,260
to a compassionate path

104
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,820
remember that it doesn't matter

105
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,460
if you feel you actually have these qualities or not

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,620
just imagine that you have them

107
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,980
it may be difficult to imagine yourself with these qualities

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,440
but no one gains them overnight

109
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,880
like anything else

110
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,940
being wise

111
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,620
strong

112
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,180
warm

113
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,220
and responsible

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,220
comes with time and practice
