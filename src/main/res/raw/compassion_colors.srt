1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,400
find a comfortable position

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,320
you can close your eyes

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,720
or just look down

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,680
or have an unfocused gaze

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,180
lift your shoulders

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,400
up and back

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,660
and notice how this creates a concave curve in your back

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,860
that lifts your diaphragm

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,860
when we are stressed

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,360
the body tends to curl inwards

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,080
so here we open up the chest and body

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,380
let the body support itself

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,040
rather than leaning or slouching

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,700
your shoulders are in line with the hips

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,640
and feet are flat on the floor

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,540
or resting comfortably

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,780
a shoulders width apart

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,980
everything is in line

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,520
we are sitting with dignity

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,520
confidence

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,600
and attention

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,200
next

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,040
form a friendly expression on your
face

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,920
as if you're showing friendship

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,120
or affection for someone you care about

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,440
so now with our compassion posture

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,740
we are going to move gently into soothing and grounding breathing rhythms

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,720
we breathe in gently

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
through the nose

30
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,860
for around five seconds

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,120
noticing the stillness at the top of the breath

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,060
and then breathing out for around five seconds

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,160
noticing the stillness at the bottom of the breath

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,320
we are breathing in

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
and out

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,480
through the nose

37
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,860
gently

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,100
not flaring the nostrils

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,060
easy in

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
and easy out

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,160
bring yourself to a sense of calm

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,680
and allow yourself to simply breathe

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,960
and simply be

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,440
when you're ready to move on

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,860
imagine a color that you associate with compassion

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,720
kindness

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,460
or warmth

48
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,500
there are no rules on what this color can be

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,720
it will likely be different for everyone

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,540
it only needs to remind you of compassion

51
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,980
imagine this compassionate color surrounding you

52
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,520
once it has surrounded you

53
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,480
imagine it entering through your
chest

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,920
near your heart

55
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,840
and slowly spreading through every inch of your
body

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,540
if this imagery doesn't call to you

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,040
try imagining a mist

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,200
or beam of light made of this color

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,060
that slowly drifts or flows through you

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,780
as the color permeates your body

61
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,620
focus on this color is one of wisdom

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,540
strength

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,120
warmth

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
and total kindness

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,460
create an expression on your face

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,340
that matches the feelings of this color

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,380
and allow yourself to keep this expression on your face

68
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,760
as you practice this exercise

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
as you imagine the color flowing through you

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,460
focus on the feeling that this color sole purpose

71
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,940
is to help you

72
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,320
strengthen you

73
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,740
and support you

74
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,380
allow yourself to feel supported

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
and loved
