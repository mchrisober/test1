1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,360
The human heart has extraordinary capacity to hold and transform the sorrows of life

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,720
into a great stream of compassion.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,200
Compassion is the movement of concern and kindness in response to the difficulty of any living being.

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:30,280
Compassion arises when you allow the heart to be touched by the pain and need of another.

5
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,060
Allow yourself to sit still and in a centered and quiet way,

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,540
breathe softly and feel your body,

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,080
feel your heartbeat,

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,160
feel the life within you.

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,620
Feel how you treasure your own life, how you guard yourself in the face of your sorrows.

10
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,800
Now gently bring to mind someone close to you whom you dearly love,

11
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,900
picture them and feel your caring for them,

12
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,540
notice how you can hold them in your heart

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:13,540
then let yourself be aware of their sorrows, their measure of suffering.

14
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:26,120
Feel how your heart opens naturally moving toward them to wish them well,

15
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:34,580
to extend comfort, to share in their pain and meet it with compassion.

16
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,520
This is the natural response of the heart.

17
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,960
Along with this response begin to wish them well reciting the phrase:

18
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,060
may you be free from suffering, may you be at peace.

19
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,260
Wishing this to your loved one while holding them in your heart of compassion:

20
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,520
may you be free from suffering, may you be at peace.

21
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,640
After you feel your deep caring for this person close to you

22
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,220
turn your compassion heart toward yourself

23
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,280
becoming aware of your own measure of sorrow,

24
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,600
your own measure of pain

25
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,380
and then recite the phrase:

26
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,820
may I be free from suffering, may I be at peace.

27
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,860
Again, may I be free from suffering may I be at peace.

28
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,440
Gently hold yourself in this heart of compassion:

29
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,380
may I be free from suffering, may I be at peace.

30
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:52,000
Then gently shifting extend your compassion to others you know,

31
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,840
picture your loved ones one at a time,

32
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,680
hold the image of each in your heart and be aware of their difficulties.

33
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,160
Begin to wish them well:

34
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,720
may you be free from suffering, may you be at peace.

35
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,780
Hold them in your heart of compassion

36
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,760
wishing them well:

37
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,160
may you be free from suffering, may you be at peace.

38
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,500
Now gradually open your compassion heart further

39
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,540
opening to your neighbors and all those who live far away

40
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,640
and finally to the brotherhood and sisterhood of all beings.

41
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Let yourself feel how the beauty of every being brings your joy

42
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,660
and how the suffering of every being brings you pain.

43
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,240
Feel your tender-hearted connection with all of life and its creatures,

44
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,340
notice how it moves with their sorrows and holds them in compassion.

45
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,500
Let your heart become a transformer for the sorrows of the world,

46
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,720
fill your breath in the area of your heart

47
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,300
as if you could breathe gently in and out of your heart.

48
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,360
Feel the kindness of your heart and envision it with each breath.

49
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,220
Imagine that with your heart you can touch the pain of others,

50
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,280
that you could breathe out compassion.

51
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,880
With each breath wish all living beings well.

52
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,660
Extend your caring and merciful heart to them

53
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,440
wishing all:

54
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,480
may you be free from suffering, may you be at peace.

55
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,400
Again, wishing all living beings well:

56
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,240
may you be free from suffering, may you be at peace.

57
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,840
Sit quietly here and let your breath and heart rest naturally as a

58
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,040
center of compassion in the midst of the world.

59
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,680
Now gently take a moment to return to the space that you're seated in

60
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,980
by opening your eyes and seeing all that is around you,

61
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,320
by hearing the sounds in the room,

62
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,780
by joining the world,

63
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,580
by being here and now in this space.

64
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,680
Thank you for doing this loving-kindness meditation.
