1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,620
start by finding your soothing

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,720
rhythm breathing

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,400
have a compassionate expression on your face

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,580
next

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
find a comfortable position

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,780
you can close your eyes

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,480
or just look down

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,120
or have an unfocused gaze

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,600
lift your shoulders up and back

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,380
and notice how this creates a concave curve in your back

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,580
that lifts your diaphragm

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,560
when we are stressed

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,820
the body tends to curl inwards

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,020
so here we open up the chest and body

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,580
let the body support itself

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,220
rather than leaning or slouching against the back of your chair

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,140
your shoulders are in line with your hips

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,720
and your feet are flat on the floor

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,100
shoulders width apart

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,820
everything is in line

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,000
we are sitting with dignity

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,040
confidence

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,180
and attention

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,820
form a friendly expression on your face

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,960
as if you are showing kindness

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,860
to someone you care about

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,700
so now with our compassion posture

28
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,080
we are going to move gently

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,860
into soothing and grounding breathing rhythms

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,540
we breathe in gently

31
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,720
through the nose

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,860
for around five seconds

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,880
noticing the stillness at the top of the breath

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,360
and then breathing out

35
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,080
for around five seconds

36
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,140
noting the stillness at the bottom of the breath

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,240
we are breathing in

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,240
and out

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,820
through the nose

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,340
gently

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,820
not flaring the nostrils

42
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,640
easy in

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,760
and easy out

44
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,140
recall a safe place

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,360
with all the sights

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,140
sounds

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,940
smells

48
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,820
and feelings that come with it

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,620
remind yourself that this is
your special place

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,780
and that it delights in your presence

51
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,500
create a compassionate
vision for yourself

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,240
it may be created out of the mist in front of you

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
or it may snap into existence

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,420
once you have the idea mind

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,200
it may be walking towards you with a smile

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,440
once you build a solid image of your
compassionate self

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,080
think about the qualities that your compassionate image holds

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
these questions

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,240
can help you build a good image

60
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,880
how would you like your ideal compassionate image to look?

61
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,480
would you want the image to look young?

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,600
old?

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
to be male?

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,440
or female?

65
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
perhaps your image is an animal

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
the sea

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
or light

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,040
how would you like your compassionate image to sound?

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,960
are there any other sensory qualities?

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,320
that would come with your compassionate image?

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,880
colors?

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,200
sounds?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,080
how would you like your ideal compassionate image to relate to you?

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
what would help you sense their commitment and kindness to you?

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,240
lastly

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,400
how would you like to relate to your compassionate image?

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,840
remember that your compassionate image

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,720
wants you to be free from suffering

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
and to flourish

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
the compassionate self understands

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,680
that we are all doing the best we can

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,560
and  it understands that the emotions that pop up in our minds

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
are not our fault

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,800
experience what it is like to focus

85
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
on the feeling that another being values

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,080
and cares for you unconditionally

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
focus on the idea

88
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,000
that your compassionate self

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,080
is looking at you

90
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,040
with warmth and kindness

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,720
imagine that they have the following desires for you

92
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,160
that you be well

93
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,000
that you be happy

94
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,920
that you be free from suffering

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,200
practice this exercise

96
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,400
as much as you need

97
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
to tap into your compassionate self

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
and surround both yourself

99
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
and others

100
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,960
with love

101
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,600
acceptance

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,640
and compassion
