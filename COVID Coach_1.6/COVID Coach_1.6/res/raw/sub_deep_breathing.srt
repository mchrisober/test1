1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To prepare, get in a comfortable position - sitting would be best for now, so that you can practice as you listen and watch the demonstration.
 
2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Later, when you practice, you can do this exercise sitting, standing up, or lying down - whatever works for you.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Although this exercise should be safe for almost anyone, if you have difficulty breathing, or feel out of breath, or begin to feel dizzy, nervous, or out of control, you can adjust your breathing pace, or go back to breathing normally.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The goal is just to slow down a bit to allow your system to relax.

5
00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:43,000
Place one hand on your belly, and one on your chest.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Breathe in by taking air deep into your belly - allow your belly to expand out while your shoulders and chest stay relaxed.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now breathe out, slowly, allowing the air you exhale to deflate your belly.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Pause naturally.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Breathe in, taking air deep into your belly - allow your belly to expand; shoulders and chest stay relaxed.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now breathe out, slowly, but naturally.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Breathe in, taking air deep into your belly.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Think the number "1"

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now exhale all of the air, and think the word "Relax".

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Breathe in, taking air deep into your belly, and think the number "2".

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now exhale all of the air, and think the word "Relax".

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Breathe in - think the number "3".

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now exhale - think the word "Relax".

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Breathe in.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Think the number "4".

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now breathe out, slowly - think the word "Relax".

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Breathe in.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Five.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Breathe out.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,700
Relax.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Breathe in.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Six.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Breathe out.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Relax.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Breathe in.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Seven.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Breathe out.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Relax.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Breathe in.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Eight.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Breathe out.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Relax.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Counting backwards now, breathe in.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Eight.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Breathe out.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Relax.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Breathe in.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Seven.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Breathe out.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Relax.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Breathe in slowly, deeply.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Think the number six.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Breathe out slowly, all the way.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Relax.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Breathe in.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Five.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Breathe out.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Relax.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Breathe in.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Four.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Breathe out.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Relax.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Breathe in - Focus on your breath, and the number "3".

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Breathe out, all the way - Relax.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Breathe in.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Two.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Breathe out.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Relax.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Breathe in, for the last time.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Think the number "1", and breathe out.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Relax.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Good job.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Even as you end this exercise, you can continue to allow your breathing to be deeper and slower - take your time as you open your eyes, and bring your attention back to your surroundings.
