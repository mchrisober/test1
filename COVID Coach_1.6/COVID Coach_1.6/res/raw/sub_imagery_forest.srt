1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
First, remove distractions - let others know not to bother you.
 
2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Make yourself comfortable, so that your thoughts are on the image and nothing else.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Sit, or lie down, in a quiet, comfortable place.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mentally scan your body for tense muscles.

5
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:28,000
If you find a muscle that tense, or clenched, relax it.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
During the imagery exercise, involve all of your senses in the image: sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Get completely focused.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The more focused you are, the better.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Close your eyes, or lower your gaze.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Imagine that you are walking down a path, into a lush forest.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As you walk along the path, you completely take in the sights, smells, and feel of the place.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All around you are trees, grasses, mossy ground cover and fragrant flowers.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You hear the soothing sounds of birds chirping, and the wind as it gently blows through the treetops.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You smell the rich dampness of the forest floor. The smells of moist vegetation and new growth.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Through gaps in the treetops, you see the sun high in the cloudless blue sky.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The sun is dispersed through the canopy of the treetops and filters down onto the forest floor, creating intricate patterns of light and shadow.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
With each breath you take in this place, you feel a deep sense of peace and relaxation.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You soon come to a clearing.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There are several flat rocks in the clearing surrounded by a soft moss.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
With each breath you take in this place, you feel a deep sense of peace and relaxation.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You soon come to a clearing.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There are several flat rocks in the clearing surrounded by a soft moss.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A small stream runs along the rocks.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You lie back on one of the rocks, or on the cushiony moss, and put your feet into the cool water.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You feel the warm sun and a gentle light breeze through your hair and across your skin.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The sparkling clear water rushes around multi-colored rocks, making little whirlpools and eddies.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You put your hand into the water and lift a handful to your lips.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The water is cool and refreshing.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You close your eyes and listen to the water trickling around the rocks. You bathe in the warm sun, and feel as though you're floating, relaxing deeper and deeper.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You allow yourself to let go of any concerns or worries, and to feel completely refreshed and rejuvenated in this place.

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When you're ready, imagine that you slowly get up and leave the clearing.

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
As you walk back down the path through the forest, fully take in this place, and realize that you may return whenever you wish by the same path.

33
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Each time you enter this place, you will feel relaxed and at peace.
