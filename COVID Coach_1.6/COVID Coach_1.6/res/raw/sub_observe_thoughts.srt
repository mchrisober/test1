1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Start this exercise by sitting comfortably in a chair with your feet squarely on the floor.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Sit with your posture firm, but not rigid.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Make sure your head feels centered over your shoulders and place your arms in a comfortable position at your sides or on your lap.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This posture helps you stay alert and focused.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, gently close your eyes, or locate a place in front of you where you can let your eyes rest, like the floor or a wall.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Gently bring your attention to the natural rhythm of your breathing.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Simply notice your breath as you inhale and exhale.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You may notice the breath coming in and out through your nostrils, or you may focus on the sensations in your chest and belly rising and falling as you breathe.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There is no need to make the breath faster or slower, deeper or shallower.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Just allow breathing to happen.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Simply allow the natural pace of your breathing as you continue to pay attention.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now imagine that you are sitting next to a small stream on warm autumn day.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
As you gaze at the stream, you notice a number of large leaves of varying colors and shapes drifting along,

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
each at its own pace, one by one, in the slowly moving current.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Allow yourself to simply be with this scene for a moment, observing.

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now, gradually bring your awareness to what's going on inside you - thoughts, sensations, feelings, desires, impulses.

17
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now, bring your attention particularly to what's happening in your mind.

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
As you do, gently notice the thoughts that show up.

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You may notice judgments, plans, and memories,

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
fantasies, resentments, worries, and other thoughts.

21
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Notice all your thoughts with an attitude of compassionate allowing.

22
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Bring the stream back to your awareness.

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
As thoughts come into your mind, notice them, and gently place them one by one on each large leaf passing by in the stream.

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Observe each leaf as it comes closer to you.

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then watch as it moves away, drifting along and carrying that thought out of sight downstream.

26
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Return to gazing at the stream, waiting for the next leaf to float by.

27
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Continue placing each thought on its own large leaf.

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Observe each one as you let it float away downstream.

29
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
When you are ready to end this exercise, shift your attention to the sounds around you.

30
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then shift your attention to your breath, and the rise and fall of your chest and belly as you inhale and exhale.

31
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now picture what the room you are in looks like, and when you are ready, open, or refocus, your eyes and look around.

32
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Take your time before you go on with your day.
