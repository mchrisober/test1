1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,960
This exercise

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,240
will guide you through the process

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,880
of creating a mental safe place.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,720
Begin by finding a comfortable position.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,580
You can close your eyes

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,700
or just look down

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
or have an unfocused gaze.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,520
Form a friendly expression on your face

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,880
as if you are showing kindness

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,500
to someone you care about.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,180
Lift your shoulders

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,100
up and back

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,660
and notice how this creates a concave curve in your back

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,640
that lifts your diaphragm.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,420
When we are stressed

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,160
the body tends to curl
inwards.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,280
So here we open up the chest and body.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,080
Let the body support itself

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,260
rather than leaning
or slouching.

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,180
Shoulders are in line with the hips

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,020
and feet
are flat on the floor

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,520
a shoulders width apart.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,160
Everything is in line -

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,720
we are sitting with
dignity,

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
confidence

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,280
and attention.

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,120
So now with our compassion posture

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,440
we are going to move gently

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,900
into soothing and grounding

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,200
breathing rhythms.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,960
We breathe in gently

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,760
through the nose

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,920
for around five seconds

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,460
noticing the stillness at the top of the breath

35
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,240
and then breathing out

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,460
for around five seconds

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
noting the stillness

38
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,220
at the bottom of the breath.

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,800
We are Breathing in

40
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,120
and out

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,700
through the nose

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,680
gently,

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,700
not flaring the nostrils.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,140
Easy in

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,040
and easy out.

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,940
Create a sense of calmness,

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
safety,

48
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,020
and peace
within yourself.

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,220
When your sense of calmness,

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
safety,

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,240
and peace is in place,

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,340
imagine looking around yourself.

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,300
What can you see?

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,660
Your safe and peaceful place

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,140
may be a beautiful forest

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,600
with leaves dancing on the breeze.

57
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,600
It may be by the ocean,

58
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,480
hearing the gently crashing waves

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,540
rolling in

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,320
and out

61
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,100
on a soft, sandy beach

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,260
It might be a special place for you,

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,960
like your grandmother’s kitchen when you were a child

64
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,940
or a special vacation place.

65
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,280
Wherever this place is,

66
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
focus on what you
can feel.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,640
In your safe place,

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,740
you may feel sun on your face,

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,500
a breeze lifting your hair

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,620
or caressing your cheek

71
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,960
or the heat of a campfire burning.

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,060
You may feel sand between your toes

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,440
or the warmth of a cozy kitchen.

74
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,120
Next,

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,240
think about what you can hear.

76
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,200
You might hear rolling waves

77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,440
or seagulls crying at the beach.

78
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,380
You might hear the fire crackling,

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,580
or the sounds of your grandmother baking.

80
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,340
Perhaps you hear the soft cries

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,780
of the birds in the trees

82
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,080
or the rustling of leaves

83
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,680
in the breeze.

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,620
Now focus on what you can smell.

85
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,120
Maybe you smell the fresh scent of pine,

86
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,300
the salty smell of the ocean,

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,620
the delicious scent of apple pie

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
baking in the oven,

89
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,240
or the smell of a crackling log fire.

90
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,580
Allow your body to relax

91
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,860
– your whole body,

92
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,920
which includes your face.

93
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,100
Let your face show your pleasure at being
in a safe place.

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,880
Finally,

95
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,160
imagine that your safe place

96
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
actually finds joy in your presence as well.

97
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,960
Feel how your safe place rejoices when you arrive

98
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,840
and feel your own pleasure at being there

99
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,980
mirrored back to it.

100
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,760
Create an emotional connection with this place

101
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,920
and return to it

102
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,840
whenever you need to feel safe

103
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,720
loved,

104
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,560
and at peace.
