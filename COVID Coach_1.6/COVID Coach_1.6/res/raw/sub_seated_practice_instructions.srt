1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,760
Please take a comfortable seat with your eyes closed or gently cast your eyes downward

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,340
and focus softly on a point a few feet in front of you.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,800
Rest your hands on your thighs with your palms facing up or down.

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:33,260
Feel free to modify the position to fit the current needs of your body and mind.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,260
Now gently become aware of your body

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:55,100
bringing non-judgmental awareness to sensations both within and outside of your body,

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:07,520
simply noticing that you are experiencing without focusing intensely on any particular experience.

8
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,060
You are now invited to bring your attention to your breath,

9
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,640
noticing your breathing at the belly or chest,

10
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,860
simply paying attention to the rise and fall

11
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,760
as you breathe in and out.

12
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,200
Keep returning to sensing your breathing in your chest or belly

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,380
with each rise and fall of your breath.

14
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,040
If you notice yourself becoming distracted,

15
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,920
simply return your focus to the rise and fall of your belly or chest,

16
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,720
noticing each breath as it passes in and out of your body.
