1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now we'll practice a mindfulness exercise using some visualization to help watch what happens with our thoughts.
 
2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'd like you to start by taking a few deep breaths

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
watching the flow of your breath as you breathe in and out.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One more time, in and out, and notice the feeling of your body in the chair.

5
00:00:39,00 --> 00:00:42,000
Notice exactly the position that your body is in.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And if you notice any sensations of tension see if you can imagine your breath as it flows in and swirls around in those areas of tension and then you breathe it out.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And now that you're grounded and centered here in the moment, let's see if we can practice becoming mindful of the range of thoughts that might go through your mind at any given time.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So if you're willing, I'd like you to try to imagine that you're looking up into the sky and it's a bright blue sky.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And maybe you even feel the sensation of the air, maybe a light wind passing by, and you can feel that air move across your skin.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And as you look up into that bright blue sky you start to notice that there are large white puffy clouds that move from one side of the sky to the other.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One after another, there's a large white cloud and it appears in one edge of your vision, moves across the sky and then passes out of your vision on the other side.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And after one cloud make its movement across the sky then another cloud comes and does the same.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And they keep coming, one after another, moving across the sky.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I'd like you to watch that sequence of events for a moment and as you see the clouds moving across, I'd like you to now begin becoming aware of the thoughts that might be going through your mind.

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Just go ahead and take whatever the first thought is that comes to your mind and see if you can take that thought and place it on one of the clouds and just let the cloud flow by.

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And then do the same thing with the next thought that comes to your mind.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And it doesn't have to be thoughts, it could be sensations or feelings that you're having, just whatever the next thing is that you experience.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Take it and place it on a cloud and let it flow by.

19
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You might choose to represent those thoughts or experiences as one word that you put on the cloud or it might be an image or some other way of representing whatever it is that you are experiencing.

20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There's no right or wrong way to do it.

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Simply practice noticing whatever is there for you, in turn placing each one on a cloud and letting it move past.

22
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The form of the practice isn't what's important; it's the process,

23
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:50,000
so if you find yourself becoming distracted or thinking that you can't do this then as soon as you notice that thought go ahead and take  that thought and place it on a cloud, watch it go by and return to the process.

24
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You might even have to do that over and over again.  And that's OK.

25
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's no end point.

26
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's just an opportunity to practice being mindful of your thoughts and to detach from them rather than becoming hooked on them or buying into them.

27
00:05:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And now I'll be quiet for a moment while you continue to practice.

28
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go ahead and notice one last thought or experience.

29
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Place it on a cloud and let the cloud trail by while you bring your awareness back here to this moment.

30
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Notice any sensations in your body.

31
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Notice the sensation of breathing

32
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'd like you to take two more deep breaths

33
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and whenever you're ready you can open your eyes.
