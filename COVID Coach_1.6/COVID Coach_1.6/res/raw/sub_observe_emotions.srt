1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Start this exercise by sitting comfortably in a chair with your feet squarely on the floor and your posture firm, but not rigid.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Make sure your head feels centered over your shoulders and place your arms in a comfortable position at your sides or on your lap.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, gently close your eyes, or locate a place in front of you where you can let your eyes rest, like the floor or a wall.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take a few moments to get in touch with the physical sensations in your body, especially the sensations of touch or pressure where your body makes SPContact with the chair or floor.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Notice the rising and falling of your breath in your chest and belly.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There is no need to control your breathing in any way, simply allow yourself to breathe naturally.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As best you can, bring this gentle attitude of allowing to all of your experience.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There is nothing to be fixed.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Simply let your experience to be your experience, without needing it to be anything other than what it is.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now allow yourself to become aware of what you are afraid of or uncomfortable about. Notice any doubts, frustrations, fears, upsets and worries.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Just notice them and acknowledge their presence.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't try to work on, resolve, or address them.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
As you simply notice your concerns, pause, and also allow yourself to be present to your values and commitments.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ask yourself, "What matters to me?" "What is important to me?"

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When you're ready, gently shift your focus to a single thought or situation that has been difficult for you.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It could be a troubling thought, worry, image, or body sensation.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Gently and firmly shift your attention toward that discomfort, no matter how bad it seems.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Notice any desire or urge to avoid it.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Allow those feelings to be as they are.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Simply hold them in awareness, as you stay with your discomfort and breathe with it.

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
See if you can gently open up to it and make space for it.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Accept and allow it to be as it is, while bringing compassionate and focused attention to the discomfort.

23
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you notice yourself tensing up and resisting, pushing away from the experience, just acknowledge that and see if you can make some space for whatever you're experiencing.

24
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Must this feeling or thought be your enemy?

25
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Or can you have it, notice it, and let it be?

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Can you make room for the discomfort, for the tension?

27
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What does it really feel like, moment to moment, to have all of this experience?

28
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is this something you must struggle with, or can you invite the discomfort in,

29
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
saying to yourself, "let me feel what there is to be felt because it is my experience right now."?

30
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If the sensations or discomfort grow stronger, acknowledge that and stay with them, breathing with them and accepting them.

31
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Can you bring openness to it, make space for it?

32
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is there room inside you to feel that, with compassion and kindness towards yourself and your experience?

33
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
As you open up and embrace your experience you may notice your thoughts.

34
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When that happens, invite them in too, opening to them as you become aware of them.

35
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You may also notice your mind coming up with judgmental labels such as "dangerous" or "getting worse."

36
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If that happens, you can simply thank your mind for the label and return to the present experience as it actually is, not as your minds says it is,

37
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
noticing thoughts as thoughts, physical sensations as physical sensations, feelings as feelings - nothing more, nothing less.

38
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Stay with your discomfort for as long as it pulls on your attention.

39
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If and when you sense that the discomfort is no longer pulling for your attention, let it go.

40
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
As you feel the time for practice coming to a close, you can gradually widen your attention to take in the sounds around you.

41
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then slowly open, or refocus, your eyes.

42
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Take your time before you go on with your day.
