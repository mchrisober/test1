1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
First, remove distractions - let others know not to bother you.
 
2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Make yourself comfortable, so that your thoughts are on the image and nothing else.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sit, or lie down, in a quiet, comfortable place, then, mentally scan your body for tense muscles.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you find a muscle that's tense, or clenched, relax it.

5
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:35,000
During the imagery exercise, involve all of your senses in the image: sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Get completely focused.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The more focused you are, the better.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Imagine yourself walking along an old country road - the sun is warm on your back, the birds are singing, the air is calm and fragrant.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
After a few steps, you come across an old gate.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The gate creaks as you open it and go through.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Your bare feet feel the rough, weathered step.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You find yourself in an overgrown garden, flowers growing where they have seeded themselves, vines climbing over a fallen tree, green grass, and shade trees.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Breathe deeply, smelling the flowers.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Listen to the birds and insects.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Feel the gentle breeze, warm against your skin.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You walk leisurely up a gentle slope behind the garden, and come to a wooded area, where the trees become denser.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The air feels mild, and a bit cooler.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You become aware of the sound of a nearby brook.

19
00:1:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You breathe deeply of the cool and fragrant air several times, and with each breath, you feel more relaxed.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Soon, you come upon the brook.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's clear and clean as it tumbles over the rocks and some fallen logs.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You follow the path along the brook for a ways.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The path takes you out into a sunlit clearing where you discover a small but picturesque waterfall.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a rainbow in the mist.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You find a comfortable place to sit for a while; a perfect spot where you can feel completely relaxed.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You feel good, as you allow yourself to just enjoy the warmth and solitude of this peaceful place.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's now time to return.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You walk back down the path, through the cool trees, out into the sun-drenched overgrown garden, one last smell of the flowers, and out the creaky gate.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You leave this secret retreat, for now, and return down the country road.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then, back to the room, slowly open your eyes, and remember, you can visit this place whenever you wish.
