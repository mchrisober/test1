Oftentimes, family and friends will appreciate being informed. You can help them support you by being specific about what you need from them (“If you haven’t heard from me in a few days, please check in.”). Or, if you’re not sure what you need from them, you can just say, “In case I am in a crisis in the future, I want you to know my plan.”"

In that case, it’s ok to move on to contacting professionals whom you trust."
